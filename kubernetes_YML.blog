Mastering Kubernetes YAML Files: A Beginner-Friendly Guide
----------------------------------------------------------


Kubernetes YAML files provide a declarative way to define and manage your cloud-native applications. Whether you're deploying a simple Pod, a Deployment, or a Service, YAML files make it easy to automate and scale your applications in Kubernetes.
In this blog, we will explore Kubernetes YAML files, breaking down their structure with examples to help you understand how they work. 🚀

Breaking Down the Kubernetes YAML File Structure
A Kubernetes YAML file consists of multiple key elements. Let's go over each one in detail:
1️⃣ apiVersion
Every Kubernetes resource belongs to a specific API version, which defines its features and structure. Some commonly used API versions are:
v1 → Used for basic resources like Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, and PersistentVolumes.
apps/v1 → Used for Deployments, ReplicaSets, and StatefulSets.
batch/v1 → Used for Jobs and CronJobs.

Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
📌 This means the resource is a Pod and uses the core API version v1.

---

 2️⃣ kind
This defines the type of Kubernetes resource you want to create.
Some common kind values:
Pod → The smallest deployable unit.
Deployment → Manages multiple identical Pods.
Service → Exposes an application running inside a Pod.
ConfigMap → Stores configuration settings.
Secret → Stores sensitive data like passwords.
PersistentVolume → Manages storage in a cluster.

Example:
kind: Deployment
📌 This tells Kubernetes that we are creating a Deployment.

---

3️⃣ metadata
The metadata section contains basic information about the resource, including:
name: The unique name of the resource.
labels: Key-value pairs used to categorize and filter resources.

Example:
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
  labels:
    app: my-app
📌 This sets the name as my-deployment and assigns the label app: my-app.

---

4️⃣ spec (Specification)
The spec section defines the desired state of the resource. This is where you specify how Kubernetes should configure the resource.
Each resource has its own spec structure:
For a Pod:
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
📌 This describes a container running nginx, exposing port 80.
For a Deployment:
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
📌 Here's what's happening:
replicas: 3 → Ensures 3 identical Pods are running.
selector.matchLabels → Matches Pods with the app: my-app label.
template → Defines the Pod's configuration inside the Deployment.

For a Service:
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
📌 This Service:
Selects Pods with the label app: my-app.
Exposes port 80 externally.
Uses a LoadBalancer for external access.

Applying and Managing Kubernetes Resources
Once you create your YAML files, you need to apply them using kubectl:
1️⃣ Apply a YAML file
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
This creates the resources in the cluster.
2️⃣ Verify the Created Resources
Check if the Pods and Deployments are running:
kubectl get pods
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services
This will show a list of running resources.
3️⃣ Describe a Resource
If you need more details about a resource:
kubectl describe pod my-pod
kubectl describe deployment my-deployment
This provides a detailed description of the resource.
4️⃣ Delete a Resource
If you want to delete a resource:
kubectl delete -f pod.yaml
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f service.yaml
This removes the resources from the cluster.

Advanced Concepts in Kubernetes YAML
If you want to go beyond the basics, here are some advanced features:
1️⃣ Environment Variables in Pods
You can pass environment variables into your containers:
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: nginx
      env:
        - name: MY_ENV_VAR
          value: "Hello Kubernetes"
2️⃣ Using ConfigMaps for Configuration
Instead of hardcoding environment variables, use ConfigMaps:
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
data:
  DB_HOST: my-database.example.com
Then, use it in a Pod:
envFrom:
  - configMapRef:
      name: my-config
3️⃣ Using Secrets for Sensitive Data
Store passwords or API keys securely with Secrets:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: bXlwYXNzd29yZA==  # (Base64 encoded)
